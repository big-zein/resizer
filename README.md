# Resizer

This is a simple application to manage your screen space by resizing it and move it to certain point.
It can be useful if you have big enough resolution (i.e. 4k) because windows snapping doesn't really useful in those resolution, 
for example opening windows exlorer in 4k screen is just too big and useless.
